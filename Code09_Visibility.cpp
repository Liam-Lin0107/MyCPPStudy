// Visibility is used to organize your code. It's not affect that the program
// will run or not.
// There are three keywords such as public private protected.

// Why you need to set something private? For example, if you set the button
// public, user can change the button to other place. However, the change didn't
// call display to render that change, so it may not work the way it's develop
// want to show. Because of that, you need to call the public SetButton method
// to change the button location, and it will render the display in the SetButton
// method.
// The other reason is to tell other or yourself how to use the class.
